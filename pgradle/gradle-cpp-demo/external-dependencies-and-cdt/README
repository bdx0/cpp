Upload the library to the makeshift repository by running…

    ./gradlew :hello-lib:uploadArchives

You can then “resolve” the dependency and generate the CDT project metadata by running

    ./gradlew cdt

Each project (i.e. exe and hello-lib) can be imported (as separate projects) into Eclipse (right click in the workspace and select import, choose existing project from file system).
